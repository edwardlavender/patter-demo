# Introduction

This repository contains methods, written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and organised as an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) [Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html), for ...

Key elements of the workflow include:

-   

-   

# Description

## Dependencies

The project was built in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version `r paste0(version$major, ".", version$minor)`) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and implements local dependency management using [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). This manages the installation of the [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) package (from [GitHub](https://github.com/)), as well as other packages from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). The first time the project is opened, [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) can be used to regenerate the local project library, as described in `renv.lock` (via `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`).

## Directories

The project follows a standardised structure encouraged by the [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) package. The high-level structure was generated via `dv::use_template_proj()`. The contents as follows:

1.  **`renv/`** implements local dependency management.

2.  **`data-raw/`** contains 'raw' data:

    -   ...
    -   ... <br/>

3.  **`data/`** contains processed data and results:

    -   ...
    -   `inst/` contains [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) [Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)-management files generated by [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv):
        -   `dependencies.rds` is a list of dependencies;
        -   `session-info.rds` is a record of information about the `R` Session;
        -   `tree.rds` is a record of the project directory tree (as generated by `dv::use_template_tree()` in `dev/02-dev.R`, see below); <br/>

4.  **`R/`** contains scripts for data processing and analysis:

    -   `define_*` scripts define global parameters and functions:
        -   `define_global_param.R` defines global parameters;
        -   `define_helpers.R` defines helper functions;
    -   `get_data*` scripts get raw datasets:
        -   ...
    -   `process_*` scripts implement data processing:
        -   ...
        -   ...
    -   `analyse_*` scripts analyse the data and produce figures:
        -   ...
        -   ... <br/>

5.  **`dev/`** contains project-management scripts.

    -   `01-dev.R` and `02-clone.R` are standard [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) scripts:
        -   `01-dev.R` records project set up and development;
        -   `02-clone.R` is used to clone the project (see 'Instructions');

6.  **`fig/`** contains figures.

7.  **`doc/`** contains supporting documents.

Note that the `data-raw/`, `data/` (except `data/inst/`), `fig/` and `doc` directories are not provided in the online version of this repository.

# Instructions

Follow the steps described below to clone the project and reproduce the workflow.

1.  **Clone the project** via GitHub. Follow the instructions in `dev/02-clone.R` to install packages and directories:

    -   **Packages.** Work through `dev/02-clone.R` to use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to regenerate the local project library. Packages can also be manually reinstalled via `02-clone.R`.
    -   **Directories.** Rebuild the project directory tree, via `dv::use_template_proj()` and `dv::use_template_tree()`.

2.  **Source (raw) data** via the links provided (or the authors).

3.  **Define global parameters** via `define_global_param.R` and `define_helpers.R`.

4.  **Process raw data** via `process_*` scripts.

5.  **Implement analysis** via `analyse_*` scripts.
